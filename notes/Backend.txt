Let's go with:


Node:
- id (unique, unchangeable, system assigned)
- title (unique - for user searchable)
- content

Edge
- id (system assigned)
- source (node id)
- target (node id)
- label


List nodes:

GET /api/nodes
- returns id, title (since content may be long)
- can filter by title substring


CRUD nodes:

POST /api/nodes
- create node with title, content

GET /api/nodes/{nodeId}
- returns id, title, content (full data)
- also tags along incoming edges & outgoing edges

PATCH /api/nodes/{nodeId}
- this updates title and/or content

DELETE /api/nodes/{nodeId}
- delete node
- also deletes associated edges


CRUD edges:

POST /api/edges
- create edge with source, target, label

(no need to get a single edge)

PATCH /api/edges/{edgeId}
- this only updates label

DELETE /api/edges/{edgeId}
- delete edge


Let's start writing out the first version of the backend code.
