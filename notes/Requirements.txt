I want to make a personal React app to manage a knowledge graph.
Simply, the node consists of title (which is the unique id),
and content.
A directed edge connects 2 nodes with a label.

Flow:

Overview page:
We see the list of all nodes.
We can search for title.
We can add a new node.
We can click a node which goes to node page.

Node page:
We see the title and content.
We see outgoing and incoming edges.
We can click an edge to go to another node.
We can edit this node.
We can edit the associated edges.
We can delete this node.

User:

Each user gets a single graph (for simplicity).

Infrastructure:

Auth: We will use Firebase Authentication.
Database: We will use Firebase Firestore.
Backend: We will use Firebase Functions.
Frontend: We will use Firebase Hosting.

First, let's think through the requirements without writing out any code.
